        We'll help you design, plan and implement comprehensive real-time data infrastructure which provides
        a single source of truth for all batch processing, analytics and real-time applications, at scale, taking your
        big data potential to another level.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Unified infrastructure that delivers data for all your analytics and real-time applications is the world of Big Data
        taken to a whole new level. While <a href="https://hadoop.apache.org/">Hadoop</a>
        and <a href="https://spark.apache.org">Spark</a> and other batch processing technologies under this umbrella have
        enormous value in its power to process vast quantities of data, especially in the field of data science, there is a
        lot more potential to be unlocked. To start, all that is needed is to think about data as continuous flowing streams
        rather than bulk containers that are shipped between data warehouses.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our focus is niche, centered around data streams infrastructure, because we recognize that conceptually data streams
        are generalisation of real-world phenomena as well as their technical representations. This abstract alignment
        has a potential of paradigm shift resulting in a great simplification of large distributed
        applications, unlocking business models previously too expensive to explore, too complex to put in practice, or not
        imagined at all. If your data pipelines originate in real-time streams, downscaling for development proof-of-concept
        is as easy as scaling to massive deployments, making even architectures spanning hundreds of globally spread data
        centres easy to reason about.
    </p>


    <p>
        Many concepts of past decade developed in data integration, distributed systems design, data analytics and real-time
        processing
        converge if <em>all</em> data is viewed primarily as an infinite stream of changes. And so do many phenomena in the
        real world
        and
        business interactions - some of the biggest internet businesses today are built on real-time event streams both at
        the
        product and technology levels, digital media industry as a whole operates as a coordinated stream processing super-program (or at least it is trying!),
        and in some areas of financial industry data streams have been fundamental part for many
        years, quickly adopting the modern distributed approach. The extensive work on in-memory algorithms is relevant,
        in its full aspect, when applied to distributed data streams and the ideas of <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD">Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data</a> appear very promising for
        accelerating stream processors.
    </p>

    <p>
        We have been part of this development. As software engineers and architects we have participated in the large scale
        applications of these ideas, and with colleagues all over the world we have distilled a set of powerful architecture
        concepts and software components. We have seen and tried some of the simplest yet very powerful tools, most notably
        <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Apache Kafka</a> and its ecosystem, which have matured over the past 2-3 years
        from the experience of <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Powered+By">many large
        organisations</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our technology stack is relatively small, based on 100% open source software with Apache Kafka as its backbone.
        Apache Kafka project has a large and vibrant open-source community and besides this being a guarantee of quality and
        continuity
        we see a growing ecosystem of high-tech companies and groups working towards standardizing the tools and processes
        to
        enable enterprise businesses to benfit from this experience. We aim to actively participate in this ecosystem
        alongside
        the professional and academic leaders and the open-source community in this field.
