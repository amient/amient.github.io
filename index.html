        <h2>Who are we and what we do</h2>

        <p>
        Amient is a company of 2 and we focus on data infrastructure and systems architecture based on a
        combination of event-sourcing and event-driven styles. We can design and scope systems which are global,
        high-volume and fault-tolerant.
        </p>

        <p>
        We are only a small band based in London, UK but together with our European partners in mobile and
        web application development, big data engineering and data science we can also build complete UIs, APIs,
        Analytic Platforms or Machine Learning applications.
        </p>

        <p>
        Our work spans the entire spectrum of distributed systems and our vision and strategy is unifying these systems
        at the data infrastructure level:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>online/response-request systems</li>
            <li>stream-processing systems</li>
            <li>offline/batch analytics</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How do we work</h2>

        <p>
        Our method is rooted in the data infrastructure around which we build integrated data-pipelines and highly scalable and low-latency APIs.
        The infrastructure and APIs together form a backbone for the ecosystem of distributed micro services and applications.
        </p>

        <p>
        Our engagements may consist of any combination of the following:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Technical Feasibility Assessment</b> (pre-seed projects and product ideas)</li>
            <li><b>Technical Architecture Work</b> (greenfield projects or legacy systems)</li>
            <li><b>Proof-Of-Concept Development</b> (usually following the Technical Architecture Work)</li>
            <li><b>MVP Implementations</b> (usually following the Proof-of-concept Development)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What experience do we have</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Stateful Microservices and RESTful APIs with near-linear scalability</b>
            built around complex data models like Graphs with super fast constant reads and a choice between constant
            time or guaranteed consistency for updates - in our blueprint architecture we use Akka as the top-most
            layer, Zookeeper for coordination and Kafka as the fault-tolerant data backbone.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Global Data Infrastructures</b>
            - our blueprint architecture builds on the Apache Kafka and its ecosystem complemented by our own
            open-source tools.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Integrated stream-processing and analytical data pipelines</b>
            - using combinations of Spark, Samza, Flink and Kafka and many other tools in the Big Data space like
            HBase, Cassandra, Solr, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Near-Real-Time classification</b> - Weâ€™ve worked on systems that apply machine learning models in real-time to various event streams - in our blueprint architecture we use Apache Samza as the stream processor layer, Spark as the analytics and operations tool, and Kafka as a shared distributed data bus between. We are also experimenting with the latest technologies like Google Beam, Apache Flink and Kafka Streams.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Near-Real-Time OLAP solutions</b> - in terms of infrastructure, real-time OLAP requires fair amount of hardware but it is possible. To build systems which can ingest millions of datapoints per second and have them projected onto dynamically defined dimensions which can be queried analytically within seconds, some distributed stream-processing layer will be involved at its heart. Because these projects rarely ever appear on greenfield the stack for such systems will depend on the existing infrastructure, data ingestion pipelines and overall application landscape.
